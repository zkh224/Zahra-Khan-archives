I created the first prototype for ICT 320 Information Architecture class using Figma. The redesign of the website is based on [Fyrinnae Cosmetics website](https://fyrinnae.com/), an indie beauty brand known for the multichrome eyeshadows. 

In this prototype, there are the following three pages: homepage, category page, and product page. The navigational links are limited due to containing only three pages, but I have added the links on where the webpage are directed to. The images used in Figma prototype are from Fyrinnae Cosmetics website and Unsplash.
