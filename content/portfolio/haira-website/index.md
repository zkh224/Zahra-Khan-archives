I build this website as my freelance work for [Council of Libary & Information Resource 's](https://www.clir.org/) new research and educational center, [Hub of AI Research in Archives Website](https://haira.clir.org/).

I designed this website from scratch using the combination of WordPress and Elementor. Responsive design and accessibility are the main apprached I took into consideration while desining HAIRA website. I managed the WordPress CMS based on the organization's needs such as using LMS and SEO plugins to make the website functional.
