My learning report for the third week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

I can identity different tech roles in the content management team which helps me userstand better about the workplace environment. I have learned the distinctive responsibilities in each tech role like site planner and back-end developer. 


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

We didn't learn about content management systems outside of the Hugo system yet. 


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

Established workflow is the main topic of the class this week. I have a better understanding of how the workflow works in a content management context. I used to have a vague idea about the concept of workflow. Now I have learned that workflow requires a team of different roles (like a developer, administrator, editor, etc) in order to achieve the project goal. 


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

We have learned about using Microsoft Teams as a communication and planner tool for our team project. Using that application helps me to communicate with my team members and organize our project goals effectively.


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

For this week, using Microsoft Teams and playing around with its features is my self-directed learning. I have figured out the useful application features that would help my group to organize our job responsibilities and project goals.
