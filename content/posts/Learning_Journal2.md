My learning report for the second week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

I have better understanding about the Markdown elements. I learned that formatting text in Hugo website is called "Markdown". I did use bold and adding link styles in the first week, but I didn't know they fall under the Markdown syntax. It helps me to differentiate between HTML and Markdown markup languages. 


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

We didn't learn about the content management system outside of Hugo yet, hence this question is not applicable for this week. 


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

I have learned to manage image content in GitHub repository. I did the step-by-step process of adding an image on my website. I have also learned to add a new "About" menu button on my homepage by adding the code in config file. 


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

I have understand better about how HTML are interrelated to the content management system. Some HTML elements like <table> works on the Markdown coding which makes it easy to add an extra style that is otherwise not available for the Markdown element. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

I have compared HTML/CSS coding and the website to puzzle out the purpose of the code pieces such as <strong> and <td> tags in the Explore activity. I went to the Markdown guide websites like this [one](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) to learn the differences between HTML and Markdown coding.
