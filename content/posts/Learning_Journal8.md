My learning report for the eighth week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

I can identify different features of CMS such as platform, license structure, and ease of use. Knowing different aspects of CMS helps me understand how companies select the best CMS for their priorities. 


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

This week we learn about the CMS systems outside of WordPress and Hugo. I did the exploration for Shopify and Jekyll which their CMS have different functions and purpose. Doing the exploration made me understand about the big companies' value for CMS. 


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

I did the role of the administrator where I monitor my group's workflow. I made sure that my team finishes work before the deadline. I provided feedback to both editors and developers so that they can finalize the blog before publishing. Our team also discussed about the workflow expectations for the upcoming project drafts. We have planned to work on mulitple roles and help each other out to make our workflow effective and efficient for the following weeks. 


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

I can identify different kinds of CMS are that are used by many big companies. It's interesting how some companies use their own CMS while others prefer the open-source CMS. From the readings, I learn why a CMS is selected over another CMS based on the organization's priorities. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

Exploring different CMS outside of Hugo and WordPress is my self-directed learning for this week. I learn about the different functions of CMS such as BlackBoard for education, Shopify for e-commerce, and Wix for blogging.
