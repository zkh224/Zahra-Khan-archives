My learning report for the fourth week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

This week I can identify the CSS elements. For example, I learned that `a:hover` represents the interaction element when the mouse is over them. Learning about that element helps me to modify the hover text and button.


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

We did not learn about content management systems outside of Hugo yet. 


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

We worked individually on the assignments this week. The closest established workflow I have done is guiding my classmate who had challenges with her website. 


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

We learned about presentation and its connection to the content. The topic focused on learning about installing Hugo themes and editing CSS files. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

I used lots of self-learning when I was changing the design of my website. I had a trial and error process of adding an avatar image to my new theme. I put the image file directory in `config.toml` file based on the given instructions from the Hugo theme website. I assumed that I was required to use PNG instead of the JPG file, so I changed the directory to a small PNG image but it still didn't work. I thought the avatar image is required to be in the static folder based on an example site config file from the theme folder. I put the PNG image in the theme static folder and changed the directory address in the `config.toml` file, but that didn't work either. I then experimented with using the image link address in the file. This experimented method finally worked and the avatar image was visible on my website. I learn that experimentation with coding and repositories is sometimes required because the given instructions do not always work.
