My learning report for the ninth week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

We learned about providing constructive feed which can be applied for the content system management work. 


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

For this week, we didn't learn about comparing different CMSs as we were focused on creating different WordPress pages along with the mid-term learning report. 


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

I was the administrator of my group again. Learning from my previous mistakes, I created the efficient workflow by making developers and editors to work on the separate editors. I provided guidance to those who needed help and we were able to solve solutions quickly. Managing the work process along with good teamwork leads to the better outcome of submitting the blog post with quality.


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

Doing different WordPress drafts helped me to identify the skills of using WordPress. For example, I learned about different kinds of plug-ins that could enhance the WordPress website such as improving SEO or making mobile-friendly designs.


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

Creating the Resource and Walkthrough guides required us to rely on external resources. I did the research about WordPress plug-ins and its function for the Resource guide. For the Walkthrough guide, I have learned about adding video and audio files to the WordPress webpage. It is interesting that popular platforms like YouTube and Soundcloud provide embedded HTML links for developers to add to their CMS website.
