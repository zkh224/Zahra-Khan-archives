**Hi! My name is Zahra and I am a senior ICT student.** My degree specialization is in Technology Management. I do not have any experience in content management, but I have learned some web design skills from the web design intro class I took back in a community college. 

My main hobbies are....
* painting,
* digital design,
* fashion,
* jewelry making,
* and last but not least, playing keyboard.

I made bracelets and earrings during my quarantine summer break. Watercolor and acrylic are my favorite medium for painting. My recent painting is a mix of watercolor and color pencils using wooden stamp tools. The last song I played on my keyboard is "Watermelon Sugar" by Harry Styles. To see my artworks and jewelry designs, my Instagram art account is [here](https://www.instagram.com/zizzlezazzle_art/)
